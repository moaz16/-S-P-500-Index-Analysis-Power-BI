This visualization project analyzes the S&amp;P 500 stock market and its companies. 

# Here is the scenario:

(1) Analyze the data of the S&P 500 stock market and its companies following many KPIs to be able to draw insights that could help investors to understand the market better and where they can invest their money and gain more profit. 

(2) Choose two companies with at least one event that had a major effect on their stock price.

# Here are the steps we have walking through the project:

1- we collected different data resources: (Wikipedia List of S&P 500 companies - Kaggle’s S&P 500 daily monitoring - TradingView’s S&P 500 current data - Yahoo finance’s PFE stock data - Yahoo finance’s DAL stock data).

2- Data Modeling: Galaxy schema was used to implement the DWH model as we have two separate fact tables and one confirmed dimension between them.
3- Querying the data from the database using Postgresql.

4- Building the dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
