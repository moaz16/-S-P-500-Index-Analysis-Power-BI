# Project Description

Welcome to the S&P 500 Stock Market Visualization Project! This project aims to provide in-depth analysis and insights into the S&P 500 stock market and its constituent companies.

The scenario of this project involves analyzing data from the S&P 500 stock market and its companies, focusing on various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The goal is to draw insights that can help investors better understand the market, identify potential investment opportunities, and maximize their profit.
In addition to the market analysis, two specific companies are selected with at least one event that had a major effect on their stock prices. These events will be explored in detail to understand their impact and provide valuable insights for investors.

Here are the key steps we have followed in this project:

1-Data Collection: We gathered data from different reliable sources, including the Wikipedia List of S&P 500 companies, Kaggle's S&P 500 daily monitoring, TradingView's S&P 500 current data, Yahoo Finance's PFE stock data, and Yahoo Finance's DAL stock data.

2- Data Modeling: The project utilized a Galaxy schema to implement the Data Warehouse (DWH) model. This involved designing two separate fact tables and establishing a confirmed dimension between them.

3- Querying the Data: The collected data was stored in a PostgreSQL database, and we performed queries to extract relevant information for analysis.

4- Building the Dashboard: Microsoft Power BI was used to create an interactive and informative dashboard that presents the findings of the analysis. The dashboard consists of multiple levels focusing on different aspects:

- The first dashboard provides general information about the entire S&P 500 index at the index level.
- The second and third dashboards compare companies within the same industry at the industry level.
- The fourth dashboard dives into specific details of a chosen company at the company level.
- The fifth and sixth dashboards focus on the analysis of Delta Airlines and Pfizer, respectively.
We hope that this visualization project provides valuable insights to investors, enabling them to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of the stock market.
